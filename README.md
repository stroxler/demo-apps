# demo-apps

I created `demo-apps` because I've grown tired of spending time googling and figuring
out tricky behaviors when working with various languages and build tools, and then having
one of the following things prevent me from easily applying that knowledge to a new project:
  - I forget the details of how I made something work (this is inevitable)
  - the original app I worked on is often a proprietary project, so I may not have
    access to it and even if I do copy-pasting the example is ethically questionable
  - the original app I worked on gets refactored and eventually no longer
    includes the code I got working, so that it's hard to find the old example in
    version control
  - the original app is often complex, or becomes so over time, so that the essentials
    of the technology I was working with get lost in all the details of the
    app's business logic (and in the fact that real apps typically use many different
    technologies)

# license

I haven't added a LICENSE yet, but I'll be adding an Apache one when I get a chance.
My goal is to have simple starter code that's convenient to copy-paste when first adding
some functionality into a new or existing application; feel free to do so
